I live in Mt. Washington Ky, and the main road here is HWY 44.  HWY 44 is a 2 lane highway that is 70.19 miles long.  About 25 miles are located in Bullitt County.  
Bulitt county averages 1% population growth for the past 10 years. Before though there were much bigger jumps in population, with 57% in 2010, and 66% in both 1980 and 1970.
In 2004 there was a study by the state looking at options to improve the HWY, but it proved to be to costly.  As the population in Bullitt County grows though the traffic flow 
is getting worse each year.  I drive almost exclusively on HWY 44 to get to my work each day, about 10 miles one way.  My average drive time is 20-30 minutes, with 0 stop signs 
and 1 traffic light.  So my goal is to see if there is a correlation between the increased population growth and the number of accidents.

For this program you will need to use pip to install:
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    webbrowser

This project is done in a virutal enviroment.  

The criteria that I met for this project are as follows
    1.Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code
    2.Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.
    3.Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
    4.The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file.

You can also find a file called Webdata.PK

This program is the begining of an extension of this project that would allow the user to select their own specific county and roadway.   This program utilizes Selenium, and
I will continue to work on it.
